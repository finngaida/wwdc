# WWDC 2015 submission
================
## What's it about?
Basically I reused last years' concept and then built upon that, so it's an iPhone app with extensions to an TV screen again. As we had to write some Swift code this year, I decided to rebuild the app from scratch and only copy-paste the Remote Screen class.

## What do I need?
- A Mac with Xcode 6 or newer
- An iPhone 6 or 6+
- An TV or Mac with [Reflector](http://www.airsquirrels.com/reflector/) installed

## And then?
When you build and run the app pretty much explains itself, just follow the instructions on screen

## Was it any good?
OH HECK YES! I finally made it! Apple awarded me a scholarship to attend WWDC 2015 with this app.

## Can I use it?
Sure! Go ahead and clone it, fork it, download it, do whatever the hell you want, just please don't distribute it under your name. :)
