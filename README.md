Finn Gaida WWDC applications ![travis](https://travis-ci.org/finngaida/wwdc.svg?branch=master)

In this repository you will find records of my 2013, 2014 and 2015 app. They are separated into the `2013`, the `2014` and the `2015` folders.
In '13 and '14 I didn't win, but in 2015 I finally made it! 🎉
2016 application is in Review.

License is pretty much Apache, do with it what you want and let me know when you built something of it. 😊
